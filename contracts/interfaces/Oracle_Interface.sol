/**
    @title Oracle_Interface, an interface for b0x compatible oracle contracts

    This interface is meant to be inherited by contracts implementing a 
    compatible oracle solution for b0x. The functions should provide logic
    for price discovery of ERC20 token pairs, and handle the trading of
    those pairs through an on-chain mechanism. All functions are called by b0x,
    so all must be implemented. If a function is unneeded in a particular
    use-case, simply return immediately, but with a True value for Boolean
    returns.

    Care should be taken to define appropriate levels of security to prevent
    unauthorized use to functions that would normally be called by the b0x
    calling contract. One way of doing this is with the Ownable contract from
    OpenZeppelin.

    !!! Safeguard of user funds should be of the utmost importance !!!

    Note to EthDenver hackers:
    Mock-up/simulate the data as much as you need to!
