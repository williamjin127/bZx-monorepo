# Setting up your project

You can expect compatibility with Node.js 10.x soon.

### Install

Since version 1.x of this package, we stick with Semantic Versioning 2.0.0, so we recommend you to import bzx.js with a caret ^ in the version number to take advantage of non-breaking bug fixes.

`npm install bzx.js@^0.3.0 --save`

Using Yarn:

`yarn add bzx.js@^0.3.0`

### Import

Using `import`:

```javascript
import { BZxJS } from "bzx.js";
```
